# AgentWalker - RL in 3D
CKG's custom Unity Environment for testing RL agents in a 3D space, included is the requirements.txt file (involves cloning [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_18_docs))

Also included is the custom environment executable (can be imported as a custom env with Gym) for both MacOS ("Environment-1.app") & certain Linux Based Systems ("Environment-1.x86_64")

This env is significantly harder than the old school Cartpole-esque problems, nice intermediate step for training RL agents
